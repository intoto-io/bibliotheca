# `<Profile />` component

### [Live Demo](https://intoto-bibliotheca.netlify.app/?path=/story/components-profile--default)

Profile stands for river profile. It allows rendering of a cross-section of a river. The current water-level, mean level, and a generated bridge can be added.

## Installation

Add Profile to your project with the following command:

```
npm i @intoto-dev/bibliotheca-profile
```

## Basic Usage

The only required property to pass is `profile` which contains a list of points to draw the cross-section. Each item is an object consisting of `x` and `msl`, `x` being the x-coordinate in meters and `msl` being meters above sea level.

```tsx
import { Profile } from '@intoto-dev/bibliotheca-profile';

const profile = [
  { x: 0, y: 10 },
  { x: 2, y: 8 },
  { x: 3, y: 7 },
  { x: 6, y: 7 },
  { x: 7, y: 8 },
  { x: 9, y: 10 },
]; // Array of profile points

<Profile profile={profile} />;
```

## Future Work

- Add a custom bridge polygon to visualise the true shape of the bridge.
